Overview
========

With ``mgit``, you can pull/fetch several projects at once,
and also auto-cleanup dangling branches (from past pull requests).

A colored output is provided if possible, ``mgit`` should come in handy in general for:

- quickly getting an overview of what's up with N git projects
- fetch/pull N git objects at once
- clone missing projects (useful if you tend to clone projects from same remote in one common folder)


Example usage
=============

``mgit`` can show you what's the status of all your git projects in a folder, for example my repos::

    ~/dev/github: mgit
    ~/dev/github: 4 github/zsimic
         mgit: [master] up to date
      pickley: [master] 1 diff, up to date*  last fetch 3w 4d ago
        runez: [master] up to date*  last fetch 3w 4d ago
    setupmeta: [master] up to date*  last fetch 4d 23h ago


Here we can see that I have 4 repos in ``~/dev/github`` (and all 4 come from ``github/zsimic``),
3 of them haven't been fetched in a while.
We can fetch them all at once with ``--fetch`` (or ``-f``)::

    ~/dev/github: mgit --fetch
    ~/dev/github: 4 github/zsimic
         mgit: [master] up to date
      pickley: [master] 1 diff, up to date
        runez: [master] up to date
    setupmeta: [master] up to date


Now all projects have been refreshed, and we can see there's nothing new
(otherwise we'd see a mention of the form ``2 commits behind``).
The output also shows that one of the projects has uncommitted files.

Modified files are shown if only one project is in scope, for example::

    ~/dev/github: mgit pickley
    pickley: [master] 1 diff, up to date
       M tox.ini


Above, we can see that the modified file in question is ``tox.ini`` in that project.
We can get the same effect using the ``-verbose`` (or ``-v``) flag,
like for example with 2 projects with modified files::

    ~/dev/github: mgit -v
    ~/dev/github: 4 github/zsimic
    mgit: [master] 1 diff, up to date
       M README.rst
    pickley: [master] 1 diff, up to date
       M tox.ini
    runez: [master] up to date
    setupmeta: [master] up to date
